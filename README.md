# CS305 – Secure Software Portfolio  

## Artemis Financial Project Reflection  

**1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements.**  
My client was Artemis Financial, a financial services company that wanted to make their software more secure. They asked me to look for vulnerabilities and make sure the system used good security practices like encryption and SSL.  

**2. What did you do well when finding vulnerabilities? Why is secure coding important?**  
I think I did a good job spotting weaknesses and explaining how to fix them. Secure coding matters because it helps protect customer information and prevents attacks. Good security also builds trust with customers and protects the company’s reputation.  

**3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful?**  
The hardest part was making sure I didn’t miss small details that could still cause problems. But this was also one of the most useful parts because it pushed me to slow down and be thorough.  

**4. How did you increase layers of security, and what would you use in the future?**  
I added security by turning on HTTPS, creating a certificate, and making sure data was encrypted. In the future, I’d use tools like OWASP and follow NIST standards to check for vulnerabilities and decide how to fix them.  

**5. How did you make sure the code was functional and secure?**  
After making changes, I tested the program to confirm everything still worked and that no new issues were created. I also checked the SSL certificate and logs to be sure the secure setup was correct.  

**6. What resources, tools, or practices did you use?**  
I used OWASP guidelines, the Java Keytool, and practices like input validation, password hashing, and HTTPS setup. These are all useful tools I can use again in future projects.  

**7. What might you show employers from this assignment?**  
I’d show employers the Secure Software Practices Report and the project I set up with SSL. Both show that I know how to secure an application and explain my work clearly.
