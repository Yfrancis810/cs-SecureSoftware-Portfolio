# CS255 – System Analysis and Design Portfolio
DriverPass Project Reflection
	•	Project Summary
	•	DriverPass needed a system to help students get ready for their driving test.
	•	The system included practice tests online, a way to book lessons, track progress, and give reports to students and instructors.
	•	The goal was to make it easier for students to study and practice.
	•	What I Did Well
	•	I understood what the users needed and wrote clear requirements.
	•	I kept my work simple and organized so anyone could understand it.
	•	What I Would Improve
	•	I should have been more exact about performance. For example, saying “pages load in 2 seconds” instead of just “quickly.”
	•	I also could have matched my design more closely to the client’s sketches.
	•	How I Met User Needs
	•	I made sure to include all important features: registration, practice tests, scheduling, and reporting.
	•	This is important because the system should help users and not make things harder.
	•	My Approach to Software Design
	•	First, gather requirements.
	•	Second, make process and object models.
	•	Third, improve the design with feedback.
	•	In the future, I would add prototypes and user stories so the design shows real-life use and makes more sense to users.
